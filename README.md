1. Get a real device. Emulator never works.
2. Have your Android Studio, Android SDK/NDK set up.
3. Run sdl2.sh in the third_party folder to compile the static sdl2 libs.
4. Open the the project with Android Studio(v2.3.2 for me), and connect your device, hit run/debug button.
5. Next step, update native-lib.cpp and assets folder with your own code.
